# Vending Machine Project - Version 2 (Python)

This project is a Python version inspired by my original Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project written in C.  
Iâ€™m building this as part of learning Python and improving my programming skills.

## Features
- Add new drinks
- Restock existing drinks
- Display current stock and prices
- Customer purchase with payment and change handling

## Future Updates
I will continue to enhance this project by adding new features and improving the user experience.  
Look out for upcoming GUI integration and other improvements!
